Chronicle is a turn-based RPG. Characters move around on a square grid, then use Abilities to affect each other.
Chronicle is arranged in a sequence of Encounters, where one side of Characters faces off against another.
Each Character in an Encounter takes turns moving around and activating Abilities.
Each character starts out with a pool of health. When that health drops to 0, the Character dies.
When only one side of Characters is victorious, the Encounter ends.

Characters are represented on the grid by Sprites, pictures of the character that can animate and move around.
They also have HealthBars that hover over the Sprites to show the user how injured they are.
The player interacts with the game by moving the Character(s) they control around on the map, looking at a CombatMenu that shows which
Abilities the Character they're controlling has access to, and selecting which Ability to use.

Characters are defined by their CharacterClasses. Each Character has up to four CharacterClasses. Each CharacterClass
comes with a set of Abilities, which the Character gains access to if they're high enough level in that class.
For example, Flin can be a level 10 Warrior, level 3 Berserker, level 2 General, and level 1 Purger. His set of abilities contains
all the abilities each of those classes has at the listed level or below.

When a Character activates an Ability, they must also choose a target Character. The Ability then modifies the source and/or
target Character in various ways. For example, Shatter forces the target to take damage, reducing their health.
The most important methods an Ability has to affect a Character are, currently, triggers. Triggers are events that wait to happen
until a certain action is taken by the Character. The ability stores the effects of each trigger.

For example, when a Warrior hits a Mage with the Ability ShieldBash, ShieldBash sets a trigger that will execute the next time the
Mage tries to use an ability. ShieldBash prevents the Mage from using the ability, and then the trigger is cleared so that it will
not happen again.

Sometimes, activating an Ability requires enough of a certain EnergyType. For example, to cast Frostbolt successfully, a Character must
have access to at least 2 Mana. How much energy a Character has is determined by which CharacterClasses they have; some CharacterClasses
have an EnergyBar that keeps track of how much Energy they have available and how much Energy they can store when they're full.
Like health, most EnergyBars start out full and then drain throughout the encounter. Each EnergyBar has an EnergyType, and only
fuels abilities that use that EnergyType.
