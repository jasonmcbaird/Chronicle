Instant Reflexes

Passive
Warp 9



Whenever you get attacked, you have a 10% chance to take your next turn now. You have half your normal seconds for this turn.

==

This means skipping the turn you would otherwise get.
This interrupts the attack. It won't resolve until after your turn.
If you move out of the range of an attack, it misses you.

==

Explicit luck is annoying. Is there a better way to do this?
