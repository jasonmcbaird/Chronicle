Berserk

Passive
Berserker 1



When your rage reaches 10, enrage.
While enraged, you gain +4 strength.
While enraged, you lose control of yourself.
While enraged, you cannot gain rage.
At the end of each turn while enraged, you lose 4 rage. You lose 2 rage instead if you attacked during that turn.

==

If you're not controlling yourself, a low-tier AI is.

Should this be less complicated? Perhaps cut the 4 rage to 2?
