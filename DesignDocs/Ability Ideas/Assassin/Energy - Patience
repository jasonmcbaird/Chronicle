Start combat with no patience.
At the end of each of your turns, if you don't attack, you gain one patience.
Whenever you attack, you lose all your patience.
Abilities cost patience.
Some attacks cost patience; they also reset your patience to zero.

Note: You lose patience after your attack is resolved, not before.
	This can contribute to effects that care about how much patience you have,
	or let you spend your remaining patience.
