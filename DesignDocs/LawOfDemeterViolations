Law of Demeter violations:


Encounter:

	CheckTriggers. Character actually does the checking; Encounter just passes it along.


Character:
	Energy. Energy is stored in Roles, yet you access it through Character.
	
	Abilities. Character knows the abilities that each of its Roles have.
	
	Activate. Currently, charater.activate(ability, target) just results in ability.activate(source, target).
	
	
	I don't get it
