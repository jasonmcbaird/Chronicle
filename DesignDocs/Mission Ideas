One mission should feature a row of warriors guarding a gate or something, and the goal is to learn how to approach
without simply running by them, since they'll get free attacks. This would be a way to introduce the fact that
enemy abilities can trigger on your turn.
This mission could also lead to the recruitment of Flin, your own Warrior!
