UI

UIStack keeps track of all the UIComponents that have been displayed to the player but have not been deleted.


UIComponents:

Grid
	Displays entities on a grid with background art. Entities can move around, appear, disappear, or be replaced. For example, every encounter displays a grid on which characters can move around and attack each other.

Menu
	Displays various options the player can select. For example, when a character takes their turn in combat, they can select from various abilities to use.

Display
	Displays pure information. For example, when the player hovers their cursor over a character during combat, the game displays their available energy and basic combat stats.
	
Conversation
	Displays dialogue. User input allowed: progress forward in the conversation or make a choice on what you want to say.
